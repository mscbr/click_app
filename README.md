Browser Click App Game.

Stack: `React`, `Redux`, `Express`, `Node.js` + testing w/ `Jest` - connected to the `https://klikuj.herokuapp.com`

Install + serve with `yarn start:serve` command from root.

React components kept in a functional manner.

Redux implemented in simple way: - all reducers & actions in one file - no proper asynchronous handling implemented (start of the request -> request -> request finished -> error handling)

Example testing implemented - just for one action & one helper function.

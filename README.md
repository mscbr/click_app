Frontend of Browser Click App Game.

Stack: `React`, `Redux`, `Express`, `Node.js` + example testing w/ `Jest`

Install + serve with `yarn start:serve` command from root.

React components kept in a functional manner. Code intended to be verbose. `Redux` is quite big tool for an actual amount of components.

For this scale of project `Context API` would also make the job.

Example testing implemented - just for one action & one helper function.
